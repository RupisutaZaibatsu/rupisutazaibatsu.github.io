	<h1>The Team</h1>
	<h2>Loupyboy</h2>

	<p style="text-align: justify;">The mad guy behind RPST財閥 and <a href="https://loupystudio-software.itch.io">Loupystudio software</a>. He makes (vocaloid) music, games, web stuff and visual stuff.</p>
	<h2>MSTEG</h2>
	<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AGF-l7_KCLPV1narTU1sljLCQGhpyv8x8FAVTsWgYA=s288-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo" style="width: 150px; height: 150px;"/></p>

	<h1>Informations</h1>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">Formely known as The Loupyboysite Community, our little independant content-sharing circle has since 2015 been renamed as we gained new members — and to get a classier, more pro approach at releasing content.</p>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">This website contains every informations you'll need concerning our latest uploads, the way you can join us and what's our purpose.</p>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">This website follows W3C rules available <a href="https://validator.w3.org">here</a>. The source code is freely available and you can ask for it on our Discord (on the right menu).</p>
	<h2>The Label</h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">The label was made in order to allow us self-publishing freedom, as well as to help our fellow mates get their deserved attention. We mainly try to get in direct contact with the potential listeners so that every artist can find their target audience. For now, the means of publications are YouTube, SoundCloud, CDs, Vinyls, NicoNicoVideo and RuTube. We try to get as much platforms as possible and plan to add Spotify, Google Music, iTunes, Deezer, Choon, Slice and others. When our public will grow bigger, we'll add our own dedicated streaming service to the list.</p>
	<h2>The video-sharing circle</h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">Our independant circle has been around for nearly a decade now, and we're still more or lessa ctive on it. We make any kind of videos from simple Gameplays to extended Tutorials. Animation and live-fiction are also part of our current production goals. Gaining more and more members as time goes by, we always try to help with newcommers by making banners, advertizement and content for them. The means of publishing we currently have are YouTube, Twitch, NicoNicoVideo, RuTube and we plan to add our own streaming platform with more freedom, less ads and better revenues for content creators.</p>
	<h2>The videogames releases</h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">We mainly release the games from our own circle (a.k.a. Loupystudio Software), but we also help other teams by letting them bypass the additionnal fees coming with videogame releases (fees you'd have to pay for on Google Play, Nintendo E-Shop or Steam).</p>
	<h2>The Website</h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">The website is mainly made by Ōkamii "Loupyboy" Gūzen and is kindly hosted by GitHub. The project itself is held by Harry "HazOfHell" R. and Loup "Loupyboy" D. We would like to thanks the artists whose graphic art are used as placeholder.</p>
