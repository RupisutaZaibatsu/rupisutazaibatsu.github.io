	<h1>How can you join</h1>
	<h2>As a content creator</h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">You're making neat content that you'd want us to advertize? Make sure your online presence justifies this interest in our independant label: we're mainly working with friends and strangers willing to join the party aren't always welcomed. Sorry about that, but as a publishing circle we have fees to pay for (SoundCloud, advertizing, etc). We can't juste throw time for any stranger, but if you seem interesting enough we can make exceptions. Joining as a content creator can be as simple as contacting us through the official Discord and getting in touch with our administrators.</p>
	<h2>As a sponsor</h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">Sponsoring our work can be either giving us money for advertizement or advertizing our stuff. You can contact us the same way the content creators do by joining our Discord server.</p>
	<h2>As a developer</h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have some spare time to help our little project, you can offer your help on creating the website and apps. You can either give us free time OR sign a contract with us to add lacking things to our website, such as a streaming service or user accounts.</p>
