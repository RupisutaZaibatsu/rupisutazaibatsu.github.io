	<h1>How can you help</h1>
	<h2>Watch some ads, give some booze</h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">You want to give us some money? Or maybe you don't have any to spare, but want to help us anyway? We have an uTip page for that! You can watch an ad to support the devs <a href="https://utip.io/loupystudiosoft" target="_blank">there</a>.</p>
	<h2>Buy some merch, get our tracks</h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as the merch will be announced, you'll be able to get some right there!</p>
	<h2>Any idea on what to improve?</h2>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">So, you don't have any time nor money to send us? Meh... I guess your feedback is what matters anyway! Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/zCdXX9B" target="_blank">Discord</a> and tell us what to improve on the website!</p>
